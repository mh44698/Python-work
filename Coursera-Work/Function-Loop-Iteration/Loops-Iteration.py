# 4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.


# def computepay(h,r):
#     hrs = float(h)
#     rate = float(r)
#     if float(hrs) > 40 :
#         o = hrs-40
#     rpay = (hrs-o) * float(r)
#     opay = o * (rate * 1.5)
#     return print(opay+rpay)

# h = input("Enter Hours:")
# r = input("Enter Rate:")
# p = computepay(h,r)
